ABOUT INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION --
Task 1 of the CODTECH internship involves the development of an Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this task is to build a functional quiz system that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive immediate feedback based on their responses.

The application presents one question at a time, each with a set of predefined options. Users interact with the interface by selecting an option, after which the application instantly displays whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect. A scoring system is implemented to keep track of correct answers, and the final score is shown at the end of the quiz.

Key components of the task include:

Dynamic question loading using JavaScript from a structured question set.

Real-time feedback mechanism to indicate correct or incorrect answers.

Score tracking logic that updates based on user responses.

Navigation buttons such as "Next" and "Back" to move through the quiz.

Responsive user interface styled using CSS for usability on various devices.

The structure of the application follows basic web development principles. JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM, handle events like button clicks, and update the quiz state. CSS is applied to create a visually clear and interactive layout, ensuring that all elements such as questions, options, and buttons are styled for ease of use.

This task emphasizes user engagement, logical flow, and interactive design, aligning with the objectives of creating responsive web applications. It serves as a foundational exercise in front-end development and interactive web programming.
